#  Logic Probe PCB v1.0

This logic probe tool was designed to identify signal states (LOW, HIGH, or PWM activity) on a digital line. It leverages voltage reference dividers, comparators, and an RC filter to reliably distinguish between static and pulsed inputs.

##  Functional Overview

- **Signal Input** is compared to three voltage levels:
  - **REF_LOW (â‰ˆ1.5V)**: If the signal is below this, it's considered LOW.
  - **REF_HIGH (â‰ˆ3.5V)**: If the signal is above this, it's considered HIGH.
  - **Between REF_LOW and REF_HIGH**: Signal is indeterminate â€” possibly PWM or noise.

###  Comparators Used

| Comparator | Function                          | Output LED     |
|------------|-----------------------------------|----------------|
| `U1`       | Signal < REF_LOW                  | `LED1` (ðŸ”´ Red for LOW) |
| `U2`       | Signal > REF_HIGH                 | `LED2` (ðŸŸ¢ Green for HIGH) |

##  Reference Voltage Dividers

| Voltage     | Divider Components   |
|-------------|----------------------|
| `REF_LOW`   | `R1` and `R2`        |
| `REF_HIGH`  | `R3` and `R4`        |

Each divider scales `VCC` into usable thresholds for the comparators.

##  How to Use

1. Connect 5V and GND to the probe input header.
2. Attach the input signal to the `SIGNAL_IN` pin.
3. Observe the LED indicators:
   - ðŸ”´ Red = LOW
   - ðŸŸ¢ Green = HIGH
